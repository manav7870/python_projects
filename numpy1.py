# NumPy Ndarray:
# Ndarray is the n-dimensional array object defined in the numpy which stores the collection of the similar type of elements.
# In other words, we can define a ndarray as the collection of data type(dtype) objects.
# The ndarray object can be accesed by using the 0 based indexing. Each element of the array object contains same size in the memory.
